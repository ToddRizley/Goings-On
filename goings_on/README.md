# README

As part of a review of everything I learned at Flatiron, I built this very simple app using a Rails backend and (eventually) React.js frontend with Redux pattern.

The application takes in a user's town and queries the SeatGeek API to display different options for events going on today. The user will eventually be able to create a profile and see which other users are planning on going to a particular event. Everyone makes friends--we all win.

I'm currently working on the back-end going very slowly while ready POODR by Sandi Metz to follow design patterns and conventions.
